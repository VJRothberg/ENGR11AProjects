                    <p class=p1> This project was our longest and most involved by far. We worked in pairs this time to build an electric, light sensing car from a kit (LINK). Then we used both additive (3D printing) and subtractive (laser cutting) methods to design chassis for the car. This combined eclectic work, soldering, CAD, prototyping, and 2D to 3D visualization skills. I learned a lot from this project, which was work intensive, but also greatly rewarding in the end.

                    <h3>Car Base</h3>
                    <p> The functional base of the car everyone was given a kit with the parts, instructions, and a small practice track. Over the course of two class periods me and my partner completed one of our two car kits collectively. Which was a successful strategy instead of both completing one on our own and hoping one worked. This set us up for success and gave us a chance to learn from our mistakes if the first car did not end up working. Luckily, this issue did not occur, and our first try worked after much trial, error, and adjustment.

</p>
                    <h4>Building the Base</h4>
                    <p>We followed the instructions <a href="link.html">https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/A1lEYFXJO1L.pdf
</a> the first day on my phone and made good progress for the most part. The pieces were very small and tedious to work with, especially the ones with tiny color strips to match up. The soldering went alright, my partner and I took turns soldering pieces and got more consistent, although we both tended towards larger globs of solder. We learned quickly to solder and then cut the excess wire right after for the most clean work surface. The second day we put the instructions on a computer and noticed then that we had missed a few steps the day before. Therefore we concluded that a larger screen was needed to follow instructions well. When it came time to put the motors on and wire them we forgot to screw the motors down and didn't solder the wires initially. This meant that the car did not respond when it was turned on. Once this was fixed the lights turned on, but the wheels did not turn.
</p>
                    <h4>Troubleshooting</h4>
                     <p> We looked for any wire overlaps that would not allow the car to run properly, but nothing was obvious. Then we tried loosening the screws that interlocked with the wheels to help them spin, but it still did not work. Looking at the bag we realized there were still two parts left. We had missed an early step installing potentiometers. Once fixed, the car started to run. Then it was time to test and adjust the car's sensors to follow the path accurately. We used closed wire cutters as a screwdriver for adjustments. Even very small movements made big differences in the car's motion. We settled with a pretty good motion, rather than adjusting for the most efficiency since the car would quickly revert back to driving in circles. It also seemed that the car reverted from an adjustment quickly, needing frequent tweaking. However, we were successful in getting the car to navigate the entire course. 
</p>
                    <h3>3D Printed Chassis</h3>
                    <p> 
                    For designing our car cover we divided the work in Fusion 360, but generated our ideas together, and helped each other when we ran into issues. We decided to imitate Lighting McQueen from Cars. We broke down the CAD work into a couple of steps, first a simple box design that could print fast and test the fit of the dimensions. Then a more complex box design with three heights along the body, and holes for wheels and lights. These two prototype steps helped us to calibrate our final design to our car. 
                    </p>
                    <h4>Prototypes</h4>
                    <p> Printing the simple box prototype went smoothly. In Fusion 360 I made a two point rectangle sketch (105mm X 73mm), the car dimensions plus 2mm, and extruded 30mm. I shelled it with a 2mm wall and printed it. The box fit snugly to the car and we used it to draw out and measure holes for the wheels and the lights. For the next prototype, I discovered a create box tool in Fusion 360, which made our process more efficient. We created three boxes, and aligned them together ultimately combining them into one body. Our first challenge was that the boxes were not in line with the plane. To fix this we aligned the bottom face of the boxes to each other, and then the vertical faces were aligned. The first two boxes worked well, but the third was not centered, so we tried using the move tool and then aligning it again and this did the trick. The first attempt shelled everything at the lowest height. To fix this we selected all the faces that needed to be removed. Then we switched to tinkercad to add holes. While in tinkercad I noticed that the overall length of the body was 110 mm when it should have been 105 mm. We decided to still go ahead and print it, since it was difficult to tell where the dimensions had gone wrong. As expected the body was too long, the front box was the culprit. The middle box section was also too narrow on this design. 
</p>
                    <h4>Final Chassis</h4>
                    <p> The CAD work on this final design was headed by my partner but we both had inputs and discussed measurements and adjustments together in depth. My partner made an initial model of a Lightning McQueen chassis before we printed the fit prototypes. He used a couple of tutorials landing on <a href="link.html">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyqQtLjt_WM&t=1759s</a> that modeled a Chevrolet Corvette C6 in Fusion 360. The previous tutorial would not export to Prusa since it had no thickness. So he started over with the linked one, then he used cylinders to create wheel holes since the geometry of our car was different. The thickness was expanded and the model exported to tinkercad. Here the 95 on the sides, the spoiler, and the windshield was added to the car. After printing our first box prototype we chose to print the first version of the final chassis at the same time as our second prototype to cross compare measurements and get a better idea of the adjustments needed. Before printing we noticed that there was no way to access the batteries or on button so we added a hole for each in tinkercad. In PrusaSlicer printed upside down and generated generic supports. This print was about 2mm too short lengthwise, too short to fit over the motors, and the wheel holes were small and the wrong shape. The other big change was to have the chassis hang over the edges of the car’s base, so we added 2 mm to each dimension. Extending the car’s height only in the back proved impossible without starting over. The motors were located where the chassis sloped down at the end, so we took the motor height and added 15 mm raising the whole car. We printed again, but it was still too short and the wheel holes were comically tall in relation to the wheels. We added a semicircle shape in tinkercad to help the wheel and raised the car again, before printing our final version. It doesn't have the overhang we hoped for but it was as close as we could get.
                    </p>

   <h3>Laser Cut Chassis</h3>
   <p>The design flow for this section of the project was quite similar to the 3D printed chassis. First we started by creating a jointed box then moved to an intermediate step for perfecting the fit, and finally cutting the final chassis. Unlike the previous section, our design options were more constrained by having to convert and cut in two dimensions, and then assembling them into our design. We decided to take inspiration from basic geometric shapes, and take advantage of the box we had already created, landing on a mobile home carrying design.
   </p>

   <h4>Jointed Box</h4>
   <p>To begin our design process of a laser cut chassis, we each built a parametric jointed box in Fusion using this tutorial<a href="link.html">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrcqauNvt0M</a>. I really enjoyed this process and created a successful box, although I did not have the foresight to match the parameters to the car's dimensions. I used mirroring, equal constraints, sketching, and extruding tools to create an open box design. While there was some starting and stopping over the course of about 90 or so minutes, I feel that I am much more confident in my CAD skills after creating it. Once the box was finished we realized that we needed to adjust the parameters to fit the car (73mm x 105mm x 30mm). However, when we tried this the box distorted and deleted some of the joints on the long sides. We also got an over constrained error. So we decided to scale the sketches in LightBurn instead. These were exported by clicking on the component’s sketch, and exporting it as a DXF file. Then importing our pieces into LightBurn where we scaled and duplicated them. This process seemed to work fine, and it was cut into acrylic. Everything fit together perfectly, except that it was just shy of the car’s width. 
</p>
   
                    <h4>Second Iteration</h4>
                    <p> 
                   With the feedback from the first box we looked back at the dimensions of the pieces in Lightburn, and somehow in the file transfer a length of 73mm yielded a 69mm width in reality. So we scaled the width of our short sides to 77mm to counteract this shrinking. I also marked out where the battery, button, and light holes should go on the box. I took this information and drew in the cuts in LIghtBurn, although I probably should have used Fusion for this since it was much more difficult to accurately measure and draw. For this print we also added two rectangular and two triangle pieces to create a roof on top of the box/house base. By now we were running out of time for making our second prototype and adjusting for the final cut, so we rushed to cut. This iteration was worse than the first one unfortunately. The way we had scaled our pieces altered the depth of the joints, making it impossible to actually put together. Furthermore, the battery and light cut outs were in the wrong places. This cut had been done on wood instead of acrylic. The wood cut was less precise with the corners of the joints, and I wonder if this material change also affected our outcome. Again I measured and adjusted the gaps for the lights and battery for our final chassis.
 </p>
                    <h4>Final Laser Cut Chassis</h4>
                    <p>This final chassis also posed its challenges. I learned from our mistakes in the previous iterations, and from our struggles with the 3D printed chassis. I chose not to succumb to the sunk cost fallacy and redraw the sides in Fusion 360 (75mm x 105 mm x 45mm). These dimension tweaks were to fit the width, and to raise the height for a better house design effect. The new sketches were exported to Lightburn, where without altering, the dimensions read 111 mm x 84mm for the base. I am still baffled by what is happening with the file transfer here. For these larger dimensions we quickly drew new roof panels to match. Then we added some aesthetic features, including a checkered brick pattern for the roof, a window design for the battery access, and a door on the front. When sending this new file to the laser cutter, an issue with our roof etched design occurred, so instead of brick lines, we ended up with a filled in pattern. This made the cut take about 40 minutes, however, the effect was very nice. Assembling this final design went relatively smoothly, the roof panels were too tall, so we used the laser cutter again to take off the length, and the box base was oversized. To solve the latter problem I took the cut off sections from the roof and affixed them as tabs to the box so that it could sit on the car base. Overall, the chassis worked out after many struggles, and the oversized nature of it resembles a real life mobile home moving nicely.

                    <h3>Website Updates</h3>
                    <p>After receiving feedback from my last two projects, there were a couple things I wanted to address in my web design. The first was a functional issue with my sidebar not linking to each page. The second improvement was in photo size. I wanted a more cohesive reading experience for the site, so I tried a split screen view. I began with a three column, 25-50-25 split<a href="link.html">https://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_website_layout_grid2</a>, however the two side sections were too small to easily read text or see photos in detail. I landed on a 50-50 split, emphasizing photos, and allowing text and photos to be viewed simultaneously. I like this layout much better since I am able to add captions without text wrapping issues that I previously experienced. 
</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>I worked really hard on this project, and ran into more issues than any previous project. In the end I still feel unsatisfied with our end products, but the process of creating them out weighs this feeling. The designing, prototyping, and problem solving employed for this project was successful and incredibly gratifying. I felt that I got really into the process of design and working collaboratively. In the end we had some wood waste cuts from laser cutting, and taking sustainable design to heart I made sure to give these objects a new life and purpose!
